Software engineering tools are designed to deal with complexity.
There are two types of complexity:
incidental complexity dominated programming in the early days, e.g. keeping track of stuff in machine-code programs
intrinsic complexity is the main problem today, e.g. complex system (such as a bank) with a big team. ‘Solution’: structured development, project management tools, …
We can aim to eliminate the incidental complexity, but the intrinsic complexity must be managed.
